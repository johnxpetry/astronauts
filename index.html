            <h2>THE SITUATION</h2>
            <p>Two NASA astronauts thought they would be in space for just a week, but have been stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) for several months. 
                They are not expected to return to Earth until 2025. 

                <br>Astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore were sent on a mission to test Starliner, Boeing’s first crewed flight, however the mission was riddled with helium leaks and thruster issues, which led NASA to deem the craft unsafe to handle a safe return home. 
                
                NASA recruited SpaceX to help with the rescue mission. On Saturday September 28 NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Alexander Gorbunov piloted Falcon 9 to the ISS with two empty seats for the return of the stranded astronauts. Falcon 9 is not set to return to Earth until February 2025.</p>
